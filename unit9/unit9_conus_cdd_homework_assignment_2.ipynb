    "Cooling degree days (CDD) is a temperature index that is used to monitor the climate in the US ([see US Global Change Research Program](https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/indicators/indicator-heating-and-cooling-degree-days)).\n",
    "The EPA has reported that CDDs have significantly increased in the past decades ([see the EPA online summary report](https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/health-society/heating-cooling2.html), and the [technical description](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-08/documents/heating-cooling_documentation.pdf)). However, spatial trends vary and the figures on the EPA web pages, for example, also show regions (states) in which no trend or slight negative trends are found.\n",

    "The starting point of the data analysis was given in the Notebook \"unit9_conus_cdd_homework_assignment2\". It is the starting point for the trend analysis of the continental US. Here we make use of a CDD data set that is derived from a gridded daily temperature data set developed by scientists at NCAR ([Newman et al.(2015)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JHM-D-15-0026.1)).\n",

    "\n",
    "We use the calculated annual CCD data. They were derived from the mean daily temperature adopting the standard CDD calculation with a base temperature of tbase=65F. Note the calculations were done in the units Fahrenheit. \n",
    "In each year the daily mean temperatures were set to 0 were the temperature is below the base temperature value. For temperatures above, *tmean-tbase* were calculated and then the resulting values were summed for each year. \n",

    "The CDD data are yearly values from 1980 to 2015. For each year the gridded CDD data are stored as 2-dimensional arrays in a single NetCDF file. The grid resolution is 1/8 degree in latitude and longitude. In addition we have a NetCDF file with the gridded elevation (same grid resolution).\n",

    "Reading and working with NetCDF files  is supported through the package xarray. \n",

    "The xarray package builds upon the numpy package and provides many useful methods to analyze gridded data. Here we extract the data and assign them to variables of type numpy array.
