In summary, you can find plenty of good youtube videos, tutorials and example web pages that explain the elements use in this notebook that give a more appealing layout to the Notebook. Please remember that you use this template for the organization of your homeworks. The first time we will be giving you feedback. Points will be deducted when you do not make use of markup cells, text highlighting (font modifiers such as *italics* \"**bold**\" and #Huge ##Large ###somewhat larger) structures. More options exist of course to change the layout. Feel free to explore and give your notebook an invididual touch.  \n",
